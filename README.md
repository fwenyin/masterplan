##### Project Scope: 
Create a mobile application where students can see their daily tutorials or lessons at a glance and get recommendations on tasks to complete.

## 1. Problem
Students often face problems with their academics due to poor time management (Table 1). 

From having to rush assignments last minute to forgetting their meetings, this can negatively affect students' academics and work-life balance (Table 2). When rushing out the last-minute work or when they study last minute for their examinations, students may also be more stressed out and hence this would take a toll on their mental health. In addition, studying for examinations last minute is not the most effective way to prepare for examinations. Effective time management is associated with greater academic performance and lower levels of anxiety in students (Erik, 2019). Hence, there is a need to solve this problem. 

There are indeed various platforms available for students to plan their schedule, even the in-built Calendar application. However, none offer recommended study plans for students to follow. Students may not be working most efficiently if they fail to plan properly.

## 2. Solution
We created a mobile application whereby students will be able to see their daily tutorials or lessons as well as their project deadlines at a glance so that students can have a rough idea of what to prepare for the day. Students will be more organized with the system and optimize their time fully to avoid doing last-minute work and revision. As such, students will not be as stressed out and have a healthier mind.
